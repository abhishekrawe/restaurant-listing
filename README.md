- **id:** Unique identifier for each restaurant entry. It's set as the primary key and auto-increments to ensure each restaurant has a distinct identifier.
- **name:** A field to store the name of the restaurant.
- **address:** Contains the address information of the restaurant.
- **contact:** Stores contact details such as a phone number or email address.
- **picture:** A field to store a URL or a link pointing to a picture associated with the restaurant.

This schema design allows for efficient storage and retrieval of essential details related to various restaurants.
